# Data-Science-Projects

This repository contains the files for my data science projects. Each project is organized into separate folders and includes the following files:

- *README*: This file provides a detailed description of the project, including the problem statement, objectives, and any specific requirements.

- *Data*: This folder contains the datasets used in the project. It includes both the raw data and any preprocessed or cleaned versions.

- *Jupyter Notebooks*: These files contains the code files for the project. It includes the code used to perform data analysis, build models, or generate visualizations.
